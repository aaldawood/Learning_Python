A less-talked about part of the bootcamper’s journey is what happens after you graduate — when you’re searching for that six-figure developer position.
< 3% of applications became offers
I completed Hack Reactor in July 2016 and took almost 3 months before accepting an offer with Radius Intelligence. I applied to 291 companies, did 32 phone screens, 16 technical screens, 13 coding challenges, 11 on-sites, and received 8 offers. The offers ranged from $60-125k in salary from companies all over the US, and for both front end and full stack roles. In total, 2.8% of applications became offers.
Here are 5 things I wish I’d known before I began my job search.
Insight #1: Get through to real people
At first, I applied for companies using the shotgun approach. I applied through Indeed.com, AngelList, LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Hacker News, company websites, and even Craigslist.
I’d submit a resume for any role that wanted React, Node, or JavaScript experience. In the first week, I applied to 15–20 companies a day.

Everything changed when one of my cohort-mates, a former recruiter, shared a guide to the job search. He told us to send emails directly to real people with each application. It could be anybody. As long as someone read it.
From then on, whenever I submitted an application, I searched for the company on LinkedIn and emailed someone on their engineering or hiring team.
For most small companies or C-level executives, the email format is usually firstName@dreamCompany.com. For larger companies, it may be firstName.lastName@dreamCompany.com.
To verify emails, I used Rapportive to cross-check emails with social media accounts.
The results were amazing. With 150+ emails sent, my response rate was a whopping 22%.
It also felt great to hear from real people. Surprisingly, CEOs and CTOs responded to me. Sometimes they even interviewed me themselves.
Takeaway: If you’re applying through the front door, make sure you’re getting to human beings.
Insight #2: Start small and work your way up
You will face Level 1 interviews (a non-tech co
